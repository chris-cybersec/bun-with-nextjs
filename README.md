## Description

This is my very first time using [bun](https://bun.sh/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).
## Installation

First you need to install bun in your operating system.  
when you don't already have it. Copy the code from below.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
git clone https://github.com/chris-cybersec/bun-with-nextjs.git
cd bun-with-nextjs
```
Next run the development server:
```
bun dev
```
Now open http://localhost:3000 with your prefered browser.    
And that's it.  

Have fun by experimenting with it.
